         * I need to try and explain how OrderedText.accept works, both for my future self and anyone else who ends up here trying to figure this out.
         * The function signature says that it wants a CharacterVisitor, but elsewhere in the Minecraft source it instead receives a lambda function.
         * I couldn't find a concrete implementation for this method, but testing shows that it acts like a for-each loop over the text, calling the lambda.
         * 
         * The lambda takes the parameters index, style, and codePoint.
         *  index = The current index location in the text, obviously.
         *  style = A Style object, it's what Minecraft uses to describe which characters are bold, have a colour, are underlined, etc.
         *  codePoint = The ASCII code (an integer) that represents the current character. You can cast this to char to get the letter out of it.
         * 
         * If you try printing out the index, you'll find it simply incrementing by 1 each time.
         * 
         * I am not currently sure what the significance of the boolean output is on the execution of OrderedText.accept() if any.
         * I chose to have my CharacterVisitor return false when a repeated index occurred, just in case an infinite loop was possible.
         * 
         * There is an example of this at TextHandler.getStyleAt(OrderedText, int)
